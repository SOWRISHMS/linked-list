# Linked List Programs in Java

This repository contains various Java programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of **Linked Lists**. It includes examples for creating, traversing, and modifying linked lists, such as removing duplicates, reversing the list, detecting loops, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `CreateLinkedList.java` â€“ Build a linked list from an array or user input.
- `PrintLinkedList.java` â€“ Traverse and print the linked list.
- `RemoveDuplicates.java` â€“ Remove consecutive duplicate elements from a sorted linked list.
- `ReverseLinkedList.java` â€“ Reverse a linked list iteratively or recursively.
- `DetectLoop.java` â€“ Detect loops in a linked list using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm.
- `MergeSortedLists.java` â€“ Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SOWRISHMS/linked-list-java.git
